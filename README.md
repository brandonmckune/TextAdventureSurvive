# Survive.
## by: Brandon McKune
### Written in GoLang

You are a young person attempting to survive within a world that no longer thrives on socioeconimcal progress but on basic human needs. To survive by any way possible. 

#### Motivation for Survive.
Written entirely in Go - I used this as a way for me to learn the language of Go and to see what was possible. As a first installment this is a text adventure game set in the current year but after the world falls apart and aliens come to clean up the mess. The codebase is wrather simple but elegant while maintaining separation of concerns and functional aspect. 

## Warning!
I am not an expert Golang engineer nor do I claim to be. Please use the code found here at your own risk and the risk of ridicule by actual Golang engineers if it goes through code reviews. This was purely an excersize of learning and fun

### What To Expect Next
While learning the basics of Golang it seems only logical to use the command line and console output to create a text adventure game. Eventually I plan on creating a 2D scroller with far superior graphical capabilities and deeper story line. Until then, please enjoy.

### Who am I?
My name is Brandon McKune and I'm a Computer Scientist by degree, software engineer by trade, and a gamer by night (when the family lets me play). Good luck in your adventure!
